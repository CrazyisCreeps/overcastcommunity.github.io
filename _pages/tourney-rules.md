 - Show up to Discord 15 minutes before the first match starts.
 - If you are having problems of any kind, ask for help in
   #help-desk. A Staff member will resolve it shortly.
 - Substitutes are not allowed to communicate with playing teammates
   during the match.

   watching the streaming.

   or later) are not.
 - Abusing any game-breaking bugs, exploits or glitches is considered
   cheating. Exploiting any behavior that a gamemode does not intend may
   be considered illegal. Please consult a Head of Events ahead of time
   on whether a given strategy is allowed.
 - The Head of Events reserve the right to remove any player or team
   from an event and reserves the right to Tournament Ban any player or
   team at any time if they break the spirit of this rules or   
threaten the welfare of the tournament.
 - Do not use someone else’s account to register or play and do not give
   your account out for others to use in relation to the event.
 - Each individual may only have one account registered and may only be
   registered for one team per event.
 - Make sure at least 6 members of your team are ready to show up during
   the assigned times.
 - We will not run a match unless your team has the minimum required
   amount of players online and available to actively play the match
   (exceptions may be made with the veto decider map).
 - You are allowed to stream your first-person perspective, both
   publicly (i.e Twitch) or in your Voice Channel at your own risk.
 - Butterfly clicking is strongly discouraged and may result in a ban.
   Proceed at your own risk.
 - If a player is found cheating, he will be banned from all OCC
   services.

## **Screenshare rules:**

 - You may be asked to screenshare if we suspect you may be using an illegal advantage.
 - Clear all your Minecraft cheats (Damage indicator is also a cheat)
   and Autoclicker at least an hour before the tournament.
 - For all people who can change the "Debounce Time" on their mouse,
   please set your "Debounce Time" to no less than 10ms to reduce the
   possibility of double clicks.
 - Wait at least 1 minute after each game ends before leaving the
   server.
 - Do not delete or change anything (programs, files, mouse settings) during or after the game.
 - Refusing to screenshare will result in a Tournament Ban.
 - As soon as you are brought into the Screenshare room, activate
   Discord's screenshare feature immediately and without further
   inquiry. The entire screen must be shared.
 - After that, we will continue the screen sharing with Anydesk. You
   must activate the mouse and keyboard control.
 - We have several screen sharing tools at our disposal. Not downloading
   them will be considered denying to screenshare.
 - If we see that you have deleted or changed anything, that you have
   cheats or autoclickers on your computer, or are using a program that
   blocks our screen sharing tools, you will be issued a Tournament Ban.
 - Intentionally delaying the screenshare may result in a Punishment.
 - Any screenshare blockers (firewalls, programs designed to mislead and
   block screenshare tools, etc.) will be considered an attempt to cloud
   the screenshare, and may be faced with a Tournament Ban.

## **Infractions:**

**The Infractions system works as follow:**

 - **Warnings**: For any minor offence, the player will receive a warning. This is usually due to toxicity or spamming, or any minor block glitching that doesn't change the outcome of the match (e.g, block glitching to avoid death in mid). A fourth warning will result in a punishment for that player.
   
 - **Punishments**: The player will miss the next map for the first punishment and the rest of the series for the second one. The Staff Team will be giving punishments for things like extreme toxicity (harassment, being extremely toxic, etc), stream sniping, block glitching and changing the outcome of a match (e.g. getting out of the wool while block glitching, getting into the wool block glitching, getting proximity that changes the final result while block glitching, etc.) or by receiving 3 warnings. A third punishment will result in a Tournament Ban.
 - **Tournament Ban**: This is the worst type of punishment you may get. A team can receive up to three Tournament Bans before being disqualified from the tournament. This is reserved for extreme cases such as hacking or receiving up to 3 punishments. For the two first Tournament Bans, the player will be disqualified from the tournament and the team will be given a loss for every map that player has played during that series. For the third one, the team will be disqualified from the tournament. All players being issued a Tournament Ban will be blacklisted from future tournaments.




## **Blacklist:**

Blacklisted players will not be allowed to register in future tournaments. You can try to appeal your punishment by contacting any Head of Events.

## **Match may be declared void if:**

 - Event servers and/or services have technical difficulties.
 - Unforeseen events cause severe impacts to the match.
 - A team or player is disqualified.
 - The match ended early for any reason.
 - The head of events decides for any reason.

**A void match may be:**

 - Replayed.
 -   Declared a win by default by the judgment of the Head of Events.

## **Spectator passes:**

 - Players who have purchased any spectator pass are forbidden from affecting the outcome of the match in any way while they are spectating.
 - In the unfortunate event that this occurs, that player may have its
   pass removed without a refund and the match may be voided.
 - If the player is enlisted in the tournament, its team may be punished and that player will receive a Tournament Ban, including a blacklist from future events.
